# Context8 Landing Page Copy -- 3 Variants

Written against BRIEF.md. Designed for: dark theme, Bloomberg-density, amber accents, JetBrains Mono data / Inter UI.

---

## Variant A: "The Provocateur"

Bold, contrarian, slightly aggressive. Makes you feel stupid for NOT using this.

### 1. Hero badge text
`Live conflict detection across 23 modules`

### 2. Hero H1
**Your signals agree. That's the problem.**

### 3. Hero accent line
**Disagreement is the alpha.**

### 4. Hero subtitle
23 AI modules score every crypto asset independently. When they fight each other, you see what the crowd can't. One API call. Full scorecard.

### 5. Stat box labels
- **23** -- Independent Modules
- **~6** -- Daily Conflicts Detected
- **1** -- API Call. That's It.

### 6. Primary CTA button
**Get Your API Key**

### 7. Secondary CTA button
**Read Docs**

### 8. Scorecard header
**The Daily Disagree**

### 9. Feature card 1
**Title:** Signal Board
**Description:** Bull or bear -- each module votes with a confidence score. You see the full room, not just the loudest voice.

### 10. Feature card 2
**Title:** Crowded Trades
**Description:** Z-score ranking of overleveraged positions. Find where the market is begging to get liquidated.

### 11. Feature card 3
**Title:** Divergence Watch
**Description:** Sentiment says moon. Price says floor. These gaps close fast -- and violently. We catch them first.

### 12. API section label
`INTEGRATION`

### 13. API section title
**One endpoint. Every opinion.**

### 14. Bottom CTA H2
**Stop trading on consensus.**

### 15. Bottom CTA subtitle
Free tier. No credit card. See what your current tools are hiding from you.

### 16. Bottom CTA button
**Get API Key Free**

---

## Variant B: "The Professional"

Clean, confident, precise. Like Bloomberg wrote a landing page. Trust through competence.

### 1. Hero badge text
`Monitoring 23 analytical modules in real time`

### 2. Hero H1
**Structured crypto intelligence. One call.**

### 3. Hero accent line
**Where the market contradicts itself.**

### 4. Hero subtitle
Context8 runs 23 independent analytical modules per asset -- technical, sentiment, funding, macro. Conflicting signals between modules surface the highest-conviction opportunities. Delivered as a single REST response.

### 5. Stat box labels
- **23** -- Analytical Modules
- **6** -- Avg. Conflicts / Day
- **<200ms** -- API Response Time

### 6. Primary CTA button
**Get API Key**

### 7. Secondary CTA button
**View Docs**

### 8. Scorecard header
**Signal Scorecard**

### 9. Feature card 1
**Title:** Signal Board
**Description:** Per-module bull/bear verdict with confidence scores. See conviction at a glance, not after an hour of chart review.

### 10. Feature card 2
**Title:** Crowded Trades
**Description:** Z-score rankings identify overleveraged positions across exchanges. Know where liquidation cascades are most likely before they trigger.

### 11. Feature card 3
**Title:** Divergence Watch
**Description:** Systematic detection of sentiment-price divergence. When social consensus and price action disagree, the resolution is often abrupt.

### 12. API section label
`API`

### 13. API section title
**Single endpoint. Complete market view.**

### 14. Bottom CTA H2
**Better inputs. Better trades.**

### 15. Bottom CTA subtitle
Start with the free tier. No credit card required. Production-ready in under five minutes.

### 16. Bottom CTA button
**Get Started**

---

## Variant C: "The Developer"

Technical, understated, let-the-product-speak. Like Stripe or Linear.

### 1. Hero badge text
`23 modules, live signal conflict detection`

### 2. Hero H1
**Crypto signals that fight each other.**

### 3. Hero accent line
**That's the entire point.**

### 4. Hero subtitle
`GET /v1/signals?asset=BTC&modules=all` returns a scored verdict from 23 independent modules. When modules disagree, you have a trade worth investigating.

### 5. Stat box labels
- **23** -- Modules
- **6** -- Avg. Daily Conflicts
- **1** -- REST Endpoint

### 6. Primary CTA button
**Get API Key**

### 7. Secondary CTA button
**Docs**

### 8. Scorecard header
**Module Signals**

### 9. Feature card 1
**Title:** Signal Board
**Description:** Each module returns a directional verdict and confidence score. The scorecard aggregates all 23 into one structured response.

### 10. Feature card 2
**Title:** Crowded Trades
**Description:** Z-score ranking of leveraged positions. High z-scores flag assets primed for liquidation cascades.

### 11. Feature card 3
**Title:** Divergence Watch
**Description:** Cross-module divergence detection. When sentiment and price disagree, the API flags it with a conviction score.

### 12. API section label
`ENDPOINTS`

### 13. API section title
**One call. Full scorecard.**

### 14. Bottom CTA H2
**Try it. The free tier is real.**

### 15. Bottom CTA subtitle
Bearer token auth. JSON response. No SDK required. Works with curl.

### 16. Bottom CTA button
**Get API Key**

## Recommendation

**Variant A is the strongest.**

Here is why:

1. **Positioning clarity.** "Your signals agree. That's the problem." immediately separates Context8 from every other crypto data API. It names a pain point the audience has felt but never articulated: consensus tools produce consensus trades, and consensus trades have no edge. That tension is what makes someone stop scrolling.

2. **Emotional pull.** A/B/C all explain the product accurately. But A is the only one that makes you *feel* something. "Stop trading on consensus" hits a nerve. "Better inputs. Better trades" (Variant B) is correct but forgettable. "Try it. The free tier is real" (Variant C) is honest but flat.

3. **The hook scales.** "The Daily Disagree" as a scorecard name is a hook that could become a brand concept -- daily emails, a Twitter series, a newsletter. The other scorecard names ("Signal Scorecard", "Module Signals") are descriptive but don't create a concept you can build a brand around.

4. **Rhythm.** Read A's copy aloud. Short declarative sentences. Subject-verb punches. B reads like a white paper. C reads like a README. A reads like a billboard you remember.

The risk of Variant A: it can come across as trying too hard if the design doesn't match the confidence. The Bloomberg-inspired dark/amber aesthetic supports it. If the design were playful or colorful, A would feel jarring.

## Mix-and-Match: The Ideal Combo

If I could cherry-pick across all three variants, this is what ships:

| Section | Source | Text |
|---|---|---|
| Hero badge | **C** | `23 modules, live signal conflict detection` |
| Hero H1 | **A** | Your signals agree. That's the problem. |
| Hero accent | **A** | Disagreement is the alpha. |
| Hero subtitle | **A** | 23 AI modules score every crypto asset independently... |
| Stat boxes | **B** | 23 Analytical Modules / 6 Avg. Conflicts/Day / <200ms API Response |
| Primary CTA | **A** | Get Your API Key |
| Secondary CTA | **C** | Docs |
| Scorecard header | **A** | The Daily Disagree |
| Feature 1 desc | **A** | ...You see the full room, not just the loudest voice. |
| Feature 2 desc | **A** | ...the market is begging to get liquidated. |
| Feature 3 desc | **B** | ...the resolution is often abrupt. |
| API label | **C** | ENDPOINTS |
| API title | **C** | One call. Full scorecard. |
| Bottom CTA H2 | **A** | Stop trading on consensus. |
| Bottom CTA subtitle | **C** | Bearer token auth. JSON response. No SDK required. Works with curl. |
| Bottom CTA button | **A** | Get API Key Free |

**Why this mix:** A's emotional headlines pull you in. C's badge and API section let the product breathe technically -- developers trust understatement in those sections. B's stat boxes add credibility (response time is a real metric, not a vibe). The B feature-3 description is more precise than A's melodrama about "violently" closing gaps.

## Kill List: Copy That Should Die

These are phrases from the current live landing page and brief concepts that should be retired:

| Phrase | Why it dies |
|---|---|
| "Crypto intelligence for your AI assistant" | Who is the customer -- you or your AI? Confusing value prop. Sounds like the AI benefits, not the trader. |
| "OAuth-gated MCP for crypto briefings" | Implementation detail masquerading as a headline. Nobody wakes up wanting an "OAuth-gated MCP." |
| "LLM-ready, minimal, deterministic" | Three adjectives that describe architecture, not value. Save it for the docs. |
| "Give your AI crypto superpowers" | "Superpowers" is in the same bin as "game-changing." Vague, overused, says nothing specific. |
| "26 Tools for Crypto Intelligence" | Tool count is not a value proposition. 26 bad tools is worse than 1 good one. The new positioning (23 *modules* that disagree) is far stronger. |
| "Built for Quant Traders" | Declares audience instead of earning it. Quant traders will decide if it is built for them. Telling them is patronizing. |
| "Everything you need to develop, test, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies" | Enterprise SaaS boilerplate. Could describe 500 products. Says nothing about what makes Context8 different. |
| "Start free, upgrade when you need more" | Generic pricing filler. Every SaaS product on earth says this. Replace with something that addresses a real objection. |
| "Common questions answered" | Pointless subheading for an FAQ section. The word "FAQ" already says this. Delete it. |
| "Clone the repo, add your API key, start querying" | Accurate but not compelling. For the bottom CTA -- the last thing someone reads before they decide -- you need to overcome their final objection, not repeat setup steps. |

**General note on the current copy:** It is stuck between two identities -- "MCP server for AI assistants" and "crypto intelligence platform for traders." The brief resolves this toward the second identity (conflict-first intelligence, scorecard, modules). The new copy should commit fully to that direction. Half-measures create landing pages that convert nobody.
