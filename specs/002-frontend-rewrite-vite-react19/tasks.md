# Tasks: Context8 Landing Page - Modern Frontend Rewrite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-frontend-rewrite-vite-react19/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Unit tests (Vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright) will be implemented for each user story.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend-v2 project**: `frontend-v2/src/`, `frontend-v2/tests/`
- All tasks create files in the new `/frontend-v2` directory
- Existing Next.js app in `/app` remains untouched during development

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1, US2
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1-3
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after US1-4 - Refactors existing code for maintainability

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Components can be built in parallel [P] if they're in different files
- Core components before sections that use them
- Sections before integrating into main App
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (Phase 1)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories US1-US4 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for useTypewriter hook in frontend-v2/tests/unit/useTypewriter.test.tsx"
Task: "Unit test for useScrollReveal hook in frontend-v2/tests/unit/useScrollReveal.test.tsx"
Task: "Unit test for useReducedMotion hook in frontend-v2/tests/unit/useReducedMotion.test.tsx"

# Launch all terminal components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Cursor component in frontend-v2/src/components/terminal/Cursor.tsx"
Task: "Create TypeWriter component in frontend-v2/src/components/terminal/TypeWriter.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all code components for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Create CodeBlock component in frontend-v2/src/components/code/CodeBlock.tsx"
Task: "Create ASCIIDiagram component in frontend-v2/src/components/code/ASCIIDiagram.tsx"
Task: "Create InlineCode component in frontend-v2/src/components/code/InlineCode.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T020)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T021-T032) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T033-T050)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy to Vercel preview if ready

**Result**: Functional landing page with hero, features, footer - fully responsive

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (with code examples)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (with pricing)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (with live prices)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (polished codebase)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P1)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (P2)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (P2)
3. After US1-3 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (P3)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (P3)
   - Developer C: Polish tasks
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 102
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 20 tasks
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 12 tasks
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: 18 tasks
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: 12 tasks
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: 8 tasks
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: 9 tasks
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: 7 tasks
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: 16 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 47 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Landing page loads, hero types, sections animate, responsive works
- **US2**: Code blocks render with highlighting, ASCII diagram displays
- **US3**: Pricing table shows Free/Pro comparison, hover effects work
- **US4**: Price widget displays and updates smoothly
- **US5**: Component structure is modular and maintainable

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (User Story 1 only) = 50 tasks

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- All file paths are absolute from repository root: `frontend-v2/src/...`
