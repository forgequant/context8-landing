# Feature Specification: Context8 Landing Page - Modern Frontend Rewrite

**Feature Branch**: `002-frontend-rewrite-vite-react19`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Complete frontend rewrite using Vite + React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion with CLI/terminal aesthetic, animated sections, and modern component architecture"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Time Visitor Learns Product Value (Priority: P1)

A developer or data analyst visits the Context8 landing page to understand what the product offers and whether it solves their crypto market intelligence needs.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary conversion funnel. Without effectively communicating value, no other feature matters. This must work perfectly on first load.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the landing page in a browser and verifying all content sections are visible, readable, and convey the core value proposition within 10 seconds of page load.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage for the first time, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an animated terminal-style hero section that types out the product tagline within 3 seconds
2. **Given** a user scrolls down the page, **When** they reach each section, **Then** content fades in smoothly with scroll-triggered animations
3. **Given** a user views the page on mobile, **When** they interact with any section, **Then** all content is fully responsive and readable without horizontal scrolling
4. **Given** a user wants to understand features quickly, **When** they view the features section, **Then** they see an animated checklist that appears sequentially

### User Story 2 - Technical User Explores Integration Details (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to understand how to integrate Context8 with their AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor) and see example usage patterns.

**Why this priority**: After understanding the value (P1), technical users need proof that integration is simple. This drives qualified signups.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to integration and code example sections, verifying syntax-highlighted code blocks render correctly and show realistic MCP configuration examples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a technical user scrolls to the integration section, **When** the section becomes visible, **Then** they see an ASCII diagram showing the data flow architecture
2. **Given** a user views the code examples, **When** the code block appears, **Then** syntax highlighting is applied with proper terminal/CLI styling
3. **Given** a user wants to copy configuration, **When** they interact with code blocks, **Then** the code is easily selectable and copyable
4. **Given** a user explores different integration patterns, **When** they view YAML config examples, **Then** realistic MCP connection strings are displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Prospective Customer Compares Plans (Priority: P2)

A user wants to understand pricing differences between Free and Pro tiers to make an informed purchase decision.

**Why this priority**: Pricing transparency is critical for conversion. Users won't sign up if they can't quickly understand costs and value differences.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the pricing section and verifying the comparison table displays all plan features, prices, and limits clearly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user scrolls to the pricing section, **When** the pricing table becomes visible, **Then** they see a clear two-column comparison (Free vs Pro) with pricing highlighted
2. **Given** a user hovers over plan features, **When** their cursor moves over a row, **Then** subtle hover effects provide visual feedback
3. **Given** a user on mobile views pricing, **When** they view the table, **Then** it remains readable and properly formatted on small screens
4. **Given** a user wants to upgrade, **When** they click the pricing CTA, **Then** they are directed to the authentication flow

---

### User Story 4 - Visitor Sees Live Market Data (Priority: P3)

A visitor wants to see proof that Context8 provides real-time crypto market intelligence by viewing live price tickers.

**Why this priority**: Social proof and "product in action" builds trust. This is enhancement content that makes the product feel alive, but isn't critical for understanding core value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the live price widget displays mock crypto prices with smooth animations and updates at regular intervals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user loads the homepage, **When** the live price widget appears, **Then** they see animated price tickers for BTC, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies
2. **Given** the price widget is visible, **When** time passes, **Then** prices update smoothly with fade transitions (using mock data)
3. **Given** a user views on mobile, **When** the widget is in a sticky header, **Then** it remains accessible without blocking content
4. **Given** prices change, **When** the update animation plays, **Then** the transition is smooth and doesn't cause layout shifts

---

### User Story 5 - Developer Navigates Site Architecture (Priority: P3)

A developer exploring the codebase wants to understand the component structure and see modern React patterns in use.

**Why this priority**: While this is important for maintainability, it's not user-facing functionality. It supports development efficiency but doesn't directly impact end-user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by examining the component file structure, verifying proper separation of concerns, and checking that components are modular and reusable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer opens the project, **When** they examine the file structure, **Then** components are organized logically by feature/section
2. **Given** a developer reviews components, **When** they examine the code, **Then** each component has a single responsibility
3. **Given** a developer wants to reuse components, **When** they check shared UI elements, **Then** common components (Terminal, CodeBlock, etc.) are in a reusable `/components/ui` directory
4. **Given** a developer adds new sections, **When** they create components, **Then** clear patterns exist for animations, styling, and layout

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when animations are disabled in user browser preferences (prefers-reduced-motion)?
- How does the page render when JavaScript fails to load or is disabled?
- What happens on extremely slow network connections (3G or slower)?
- How does the terminal typing effect behave if interrupted by user scrolling mid-animation?
- What happens when the viewport is extremely narrow (<320px) or extremely wide (>2560px)?
- How do scroll-triggered animations behave if the user rapidly scrolls up and down?
- What happens if crypto price data fails to load (network error or API timeout)?

### Assumptions

- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Users have modern browsers (released within last 2 years) with ES6+ support
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: Mock crypto price data is sufficient for demo purposes; real API integration will be handled separately
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: OAuth integration flow already exists and this rewrite focuses only on the landing page
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: The existing backend API structure remains unchanged; this is a frontend-only rewrite
- **ASSUMPTION-005**: Design spec colors and fonts (JetBrains Mono, Inter, specified color palette) are finalized
- **ASSUMPTION-006**: Target deployment platform supports static site hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or similar)
- **ASSUMPTION-007**: Users expect a dark-themed CLI aesthetic based on the Context8 brand identity
- **ASSUMPTION-008**: The pricing model (Free vs Pro at $29/month) is confirmed and won't change during development
