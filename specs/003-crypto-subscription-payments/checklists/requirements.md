# Specification Quality Checklist: Crypto Subscription Payment System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED** - Specification is ready for planning phase

### Review Notes:

**Content Quality**: Specification focuses entirely on what users need and why, without mentioning specific technologies. Successfully avoids implementation details like "React components", "Supabase tables", "API endpoints" etc.

**Requirements**: All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Each requirement clearly states WHAT the system must do without specifying HOW. For example, FR-004 specifies transaction hash validation requirements (format, length) without mentioning regex libraries or validation methods.

**Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: Time-based (under 5 minutes)
- SC-003: Accuracy-based (100%)
- SC-004: Percentage-based (95% within 24h)
- No implementation-specific metrics like "API response time" or "database performance"

**User Scenarios**: 4 prioritized user stories with complete Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios. Edge cases comprehensively documented (8 scenarios covering fraud, errors, and boundary conditions).

**Scope Boundaries**: Clear assumptions documented (10 items) and out-of-scope items explicitly listed (13 items) to prevent scope creep.

**No Clarifications Needed**: Specification makes informed decisions on all ambiguous areas:
- Wallet addresses: Static addresses (assumption documented)
- Verification method: Manual admin verification (clearly specified in FR-007 through FR-010)
- Payment model: One-time 30-day subscriptions (FR-012, FR-017)
- Supported chains: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC only (FR-002)

## Next Steps

✅ Proceed to `/speckit.plan` - Generate technical architecture and implementation plan
